This repository contains the dataset used for the Personalised Learning System project. The dataset was previously hosted in a private repository, and to facilitate easier access and collaboration, it has been uploaded here.

**Project Overview:**
Our aim is to create an AI-driven educational platform that revolutionizes learning through adaptive learning algorithms, tailoring content and pacing to individual needs. By integrating interactive quizzes and providing instant feedback, users are engaged actively, fostering deeper comprehension and retention. This personalized approach not only enhances educational outcomes but also promotes inclusivity by catering to diverse learning styles and abilities. Our platform's commitment to equitable access to quality education is underpinned by its optimization for low bandwidth and support for multiple languages, ensuring that learners from underserved communities can benefit fully. Through these innovative features and a user-centric design, we seek to empower learners of all backgrounds to thrive academically and contribute meaningfully to society, thereby driving positive change and fostering a more equitable future.

**Datasets Available:**
